Dear editor,

hereby, we would like to submit our manuscript on "Dynamic Modeling, Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Analysis in R" to the Journal of Statistical Software.

Dynamic modeling is an active field not just in engineering but also in the biomedical sciences. Although R plays a strong role in bioinformatics and data science, it is less frequently used for dynamic modeling and parameter estimation in dynamic models. Our new package "dMod" provides a sofisticated framework to set up dynamic models, estimate parameters and perform uncertainty analysis. We think that by the "dMod" package we could contribute to broaden the usability of R and make dynamic modeling available to a new community of users.

We would be pleased if our manuscript and the dMod software would be considered for publication in your journal.

Best regards,

Daniel Kaschek
